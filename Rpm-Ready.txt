Flow summary
    
    we all crave meaning

    Think of your life like a game


    Give your dreams legs
        an overaching life theme with actionable items

    but we tend to be basic - do not be basic - do not be afriad of imperfection
        instant gratification vs enjoyment
    find about the flow 
        slightly challenging thkngs with immediate feedback. no external gratification
    Developing YOUR flow
        just a slight bit curious for just this day


    In hard times Increase your focus and decrease the anxiety
        surrender the ego
        connect with the present environment


    Fine tune your senses
        just the sight and sound
    Retrain your brain
        think outwards - think of some fun puzzles to solve
